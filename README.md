# Ancient Trinkets

## This mod adds several new upgradable trinkets each with unique effects, and a procedural questing system to obtain them.

### These trinkets are so unique in fact that only one of each can exist at once (configurable), and are so powerful a player can only use one at once (configurable).

## Obtaining:
<details>
<summary>Section</summary>

### Quest start:
To obtain a new trinket a player must first get a quest from a villager, only villagers in naturally generating villages will give quests (along with a few other similar requirements to prevent farming of the trinkets).

### Quest tasks:
Each quest is broken up into a series of tasks, each task can range from anything like creating more iron golems for the village to obtaining rare items to killing local hostile mobs.

</details>

### Completing a quest:
After each task is finished there is a chance that the quest will end, if it does not you will be given the option to end the quest now or continue it for larger rewards, the "current value" shown determines how much loot you'll get, the colors show what kinds of trinkets are valid prizes, red for none, yellow for uncommon, cyan for rare, and light purple for epic.

### Rewards:
Each quest will give 1 random trinket if able, and will choose the rarest valid trinket when doing so, it will also give some random trinket dust, or will give double trinket dust if there is no valid trinket to be given

## Upgrading:
<details>
<summary>Section</summary>

### Applying dust:
Each trinket can be upgraded with a trinket dust of equal or higher rarity, each trinket will have different effects on upgrade, however all stats that change will be highlighted bold, to apply to dust hold the trinket in your offhand and right click with the dust, this will consume one dust and upgrade the trinket one level.

### Upgrading dust:
If you have a surplus of a low quality dust you can upgrade it by dropping an anvil on it, which will result in 50% output on average.

The Eternal Bonemeal is an uncommon trinket that can fully grow all nearby plants (yes this one is underpowered, when I made it I had very different plans for the mod that would benefit with major power differences in trinkets).

## Tracking Compasses:
The last feature of this mod is **tracking compasses**, this feature allows you do right click with a compass while you hold a trinket in your offhand to link them, this new tracking compass will show the last known location of the trinket, this means that if a player puts a tracked trinket in a shulker or bundle the compass will no longer update the location while the trinket remains in it.
